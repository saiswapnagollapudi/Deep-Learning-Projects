**Classification of diabetes using Multi Layer Perceptron model**

**Dataset:** PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATASET

A single neuron is known as Perceptron. It is the basic building block of Neural Network.

Multi-layer perceptron model is the basic neural network model which is used to identify complex structures in the underlying data. It has input layer, hidden layer and output layer.

In this project a classification model is built using Multi-layer Perceptron. 

The model has 2 hidden layers each with 12 and 8 neurons respectively.

Training accuracy achieved is around 76%.
